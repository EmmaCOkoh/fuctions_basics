# Functions – Making My Own Tools!

Today, I learned how to build **functions** in Python. Functions are like my own little machines — I give them something, and they do something with it!

---

## I Learned:

- How to define a function using `def`
- How to give functions inputs (parameters)
- How to return answers from functions
- How to call a function and use it over and over

---

## What I Practiced:

- Saying hello using a function
- Greeting people with their name
- Doing math (adding numbers, doubling)
- Creating a greeting tool that takes name and mood

---

## Portfolio Project:

I built a **Personal Greeting Machine**:
- It takes a name and how you’re feeling
- Then prints a sweet custom message
